# Watch Your Step: Floor Classification for Autonomous Robots
This is the data and code we createdfor our TECHIN 513 final project on floor classification using signal processing and machine learning.
We analyzed accelerometer data to classify normal vs. problematic flooring using SVM and DL models. Our final SVM and DL models achieve >90% accuracy and recall.
